#Lenovo Thinkpad T440p Setup#

In this repo I'll be keeping track of the scripts / methods I've used to get
Debian Jessie to work properly on my Lenovo Thinkpad T440p.

In all these scripts I've changed my username with $USER. You will need to
replace this with your own user name to have them point to the right files.

Currently in this repo:
* [Automatically running xrandr when (un)docking](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/dockingstation.md)
* [Setting up keyboard shortcuts using xbindkeys](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/xbindkeys.md)
* [Tint2 menu bar setup](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/tint2rc)
* [My .xinitrc file](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/.xinitrc)
