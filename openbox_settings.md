#Openbox Settings#
Settings for Openbox (such as keyboard shortcuts) can 
be found (here)[https://github.com/javl/T440p/rc.xml]. One of the
keyboard shortcuts I really like is the ```windows + up``` to maximize
a window, and ```windows + left``` and ```windows + right``` to make
the window use 50% of the total screen width and snap to the left 
or right side of the window.

Save the ```rc.xml``` file to ```~/.config/openbox/rx.xml```
