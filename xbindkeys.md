##Keyboard shortcuts for T440p using xbindkeys##
I've added a couple of keyboard shortcuts to control sound and quickly lock my
computer for when I'm leaving.

Install ```xbindkeys``` and alternatively ```xbindkeys-config``` to easily set
more shortcuts / find the keyboard codes needed.


```sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbindkeys-config```
Save the [xbindkeysrc](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/xbindkeysrc) file to
```~/.xbindkeysrc```. Note the dot at the beginning of the filename.
