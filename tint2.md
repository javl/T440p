### Tint2 setup ###
I'm using the tint2 menu bar. Simply install it using
```sudo apt-get install tint2```

Its config file can be found in ```~/.config/tint2/tint2rc```. You can find
my version of this file [here](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/tint2rc).

My tint2 config calls a script called ```battery_warning.sh``` when low on power. This file
can be found [here](https://github.com/javl/T440p/blob/master/battery_warning.sh).
